I am currently a research scientist at Shanghai AI Laboratory. I received my doctorate in theoretical physics from the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2020. In the meantime, I also served as a visiting scholar at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory from 2015 to 2017. Following the completion of my doctoral degree, I joined Fudan University for postdoctoral research. I joined the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2022. 

Research
======
My research primarily focuses on developing artificial intelligence algorithms for computational physics (first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations), with a particular focus on the application of large models (including large language models) in materials science.
